	abstract = {We motivate the design of typed assembly language (TAL) and
	            present a type-preserving ttranslation from Systemn F to TAL.
	            The typed assembly language we pressent is based on a
	            conventional RISC assembly language, but its static type
	            sytem provides support for enforcing high-level language
	            abstratctions, such as closures, tuples, and user-defined
	            abstract data types. The type system ensures that well-typed
	            programs cannot violatet these abstractionsl In addition, the
	            typing constructs admit many low-level compiler
	            optimiztaions. Our translation to TAL is specified as a
	            sequence of type-preserving transformations, including CPS
	            and closure conversion phases; type-correct source programs
	            are mapped to type-correct assembly language. A key
	            contribution is an approach to polymorphic closure conversion
	            that is considerably simpler than previous work. The compiler
	            and typed assembly lanugage provide a fully automatic way to
	            produce certified code, suitable for use in systems where
	            unstrusted and potentially malicious code must be checked for
	            safety before execution.},
